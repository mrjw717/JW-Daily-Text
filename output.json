        "Explanation": "Profanity has no place on a Christian’s lips. But there are subtle forms of abusive speech that we also need to be on guard against. For example, we need to be careful not to make unfavorable comparisons when talking about people of other cultures, tribes, or nationalities. Further, we never want to hurt others with cutting remarks. Speak in a way that builds others up. Be quick to commend rather than to criticize or complain. The Israelites had much to be thankful for, yet they routinely complained. A complaining spirit can be contagious. You will recall that a negative report from ten spies caused “all the Israelites ... to murmur against Moses.” (Numbers 13:31–14:4) On the other hand, commendation can be a powerful force for good. So look for opportunities to offer sincere commendation. w22.04 8 paragraphs 16-17",

        "Explanation": "Since Satan no longer has access to the heavenly realm, he focuses his anger on the remnant of anointed ones, who are the earthly representatives of God’s Kingdom and who “have the work of bearing witness concerning Jesus.” (2 Corinthians 5:20; Ephesians 6:19,20) In 1918, eight prominent brothers were convicted on false charges, and each was sentenced to a long term of imprisonment. It appeared as if the work of these anointed ones had been “killed.” (Revelation 11:3,7-11) But early in 1919, those anointed brothers were released from prison, and later the charges were dropped. The brothers immediately got back to work—Kingdom work. But that did not stop Satan’s attacks on God’s people.

        "Explanation": "In a vision, the apostle John sees two groups who support Jehovah’s rulership and receive the blessings of everlasting life. The first group numbers 144,000. They are taken from the earth to form a government, or Kingdom, with Jesus in heaven. Along with him, they rule over the earth. (Revelation 5:9,10; 14:3,4) In the vision, John sees them standing with Jesus on heavenly Mount Zion. (Revelation 14:1) Down through the centuries, thousands have been selected to be part of the 144,000. (Luke 12:32; Romans 8:17) John, however, is told that only a remnant, or a small number, would be alive on earth during the last days. (Revelation 12:17) Then sometime during the great tribulation, this remnant will be taken to heaven to join the rest of the 144,000, who have already died faithful.

Jesus assured them: “The hairs of your head are all numbered.” (Matthew 10:30) That statement is very comforting to us, especially if we tend to have a negative view of ourselves.

We would never want to call into question Jehovah’s judgment by concluding that we are unworthy of being his worshippers and of receiving life in his new world.

Such forgiveness cannot come from men but must come from “Jehovah himself.” (Acts 3:19) When Jehovah forgives us, he restores his relationship with us so completely that it is as though we had never sinned.

Such a person is in danger of not being forgiven. (Mark 3:29; John 9:41) Is there any hope in that case? Yes! Jehovah also considers whether the sinner is sincerely repentant. To repent means “to change one’s mind, attitude, or purpose.” It includes the idea that a person feels regret and deep sadness about the bad things he has done or about not doing the right things he should have done.

        "Explanation": "Jehovah comforts us by giving us a hope for the future. Consider just a few thoughts from the Bible that can comfort us when we experience trials. In the Scriptures, Jehovah assures us that nothing—and that includes severe trials—“will be able to separate us from [his] love.” (Romans 8:38,39) He also assures us that he “is near to all those calling on him” in prayer. (Psalm 145:18) Jehovah tells us that if we rely on him, we can endure any trial and even find a measure of happiness when we suffer.

By the end of the 1,000 years, all living on earth will be perfect. We must remember that being perfect does not in itself mean that a person will automatically gain everlasting life. Think of Adam and Eve. They were perfect, but they needed to demonstrate their obedience to Jehovah God before they would be granted everlasting life. And, sadly, they failed to obey him. Since all will have gained perfection by the end of the 1,000 years, will all those perfect people fully support Jehovah’s rule forever? Or will some prove to be like Adam and Eve—who despite being perfect became unfaithful? These questions will need to be answered.",

During their travels in the wilderness, the Kohathites carried the ark of the covenant before all the people. What a privilege! However, things changed for them when the Israelites settled in the Promised Land. The Ark no longer needed to be moved regularly. So the Kohathites were assigned other duties. There is no record that the Kohathites complained or demanded a more prominent role because of their rich heritage. What lesson can we learn? Wholeheartedly support changes that Jehovah’s organization makes, including any that affect your assignment. Find joy in whatever assignment you are given. Remember that your assignment does not reflect your worth as a person. Jehovah values your obedience far more than any assignment.",

So he can see all the imperfections that we inherited from our parents. Even more, he is aware of all the experiences that have molded and shaped our personality. What does this intimate knowledge of humankind move Jehovah to do? It moves him to act mercifully toward us. Jehovah has proved that he is eager to forgive. He understands that because of the actions of the first man, Adam, we all came under the curse of sin and death. There was no way for us to free ourselves or any other person from that curse. However, our loving God showed compassion and arranged for us to be set free. As reveals, Jehovah sent his only-begotten Son to die in our behalf.",

        "Explanation": "That forgivers will be forgiven was made clear by Jehovah in connection with his servant Job. That faithful man had been deeply hurt by the cutting remarks of three men named Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar. Jehovah instructed Job to pray in their behalf. After Job did so, Jehovah blessed him. (Job 42:8-10) Harboring resentment is damaging. Jehovah wants us to enjoy the relief that comes from unburdening ourselves of resentment. (Ephesians 4:31,32) He urges us to “let go of anger and abandon rage.” (Psalm 37:8) There is wisdom in following that advice. Harboring resentment can be harmful to our physical and mental health. (Proverbs 14:30) Our harboring such resentment will not affect the offender any more than our drinking poison would harm the one who offended us. Rather, when we forgive others, we are giving ourselves a gift. We find peace of mind and heart, and we are able to move ahead in our service to Jehovah. w22.06 10 paragraphs 9-10",

        "Explanation": "Our hope acts as a figurative helmet that protects our thinking and safeguards us from choosing a self-indulgent lifestyle, which would spoil our relationship with Jehovah. (1 Corinthians 15:33,34) Our helmet of hope can also protect us from thinking that there is no point in even trying to please Jehovah. Recall that Job’s false comforter Eliphaz used similar reasoning with Job. Eliphaz said: “What is mortal man that he should be pure?” Further, he said of God: “Look! He has no faith in his holy ones, and even the heavens are not pure in his eyes.” (Job 15:14,15) What lies! Remember who is behind such thinking—Satan. He knows that if you allow yourself to dwell on such thoughts, your hope will fade. Instead, reject such lies. Never doubt that Jehovah wants you to live forever and that he will help you to reach that goal.—1 Timothy 2:3,4. w22.10 25-26 paragraphs 8-10",

For instance, Satan used a strong wind to bring down the house where all ten of Job’s children had been enjoying a meal together. (Job 1:18,19) He also caused fire to fall from heaven and destroy not only Job’s flocks but also the servants who were caring for them. (Job 1:16) The wind and fire obviously came from a supernatural source; hence, Job concluded that Jehovah God must have been that Source. And as a result, Job believed that he had somehow upset Jehovah. Even so, Job refused to curse his heavenly Father. Job acknowledged that over the years he had received many good things from Jehovah. He therefore reasoned that if he was happy to accept the good, he should also be willing to accept the bad.

And he uses his organization to teach us and protect us. We can draw close to Jehovah by praying to him and by reading his Word and meditating on it. As we do, we are filled with love and appreciation for him. We are motivated to give him the obedience and praise that he so richly deserves. The more we get to know Jehovah, the more we will trust in him and the organization that he has provided to help us.

To strengthen Job’s confidence in His wisdom and ability to care for His servants, Jehovah pointed to some extraordinary features of nature. For instance, Job was reminded that God provides for the animals, so He could also take care of Job.

One way is to avoid associating with those who show a critical attitude. (Psalm 1:1) This means that we do not listen to or read anything from apostates.

It is called “the image of the wild beast” and is described as “an eighth king.” This “king” is spoken of as coming into existence, then going out of existence, and later reappearing. How well this description fits the United Nations organization, which promotes the interests of the worldwide political system! It existed first as the League of Nations. Then it went out of existence during World War II. It later emerged again in its present-day form. By means of their propaganda, the political beasts stir up opposition to Jehovah and his people. Symbolically, they gather “the kings of the entire inhabited earth” together to the war of Armageddon, which is “the great day of God the Almighty.”—,14,",

        "Scripture": "How do you read?—Luke 10:26.",
        "Explanation": "When Jesus learned to read the Sacred Writings on his own, he not only came to know the Scriptures well but also loved them and allowed them to influence his actions. For example, recall the incident in the temple when Jesus was just 12 years old. The teachers who were well-versed in the Mosaic Law were in “amazement at [Jesus’] understanding and his answers.” (Luke 2:46,47,52) We too can come to know and love God’s Word as we regularly read the Scriptures. We can learn from what Jesus said to those familiar with the Law, including the scribes, the Pharisees, and the Sadducees. Those religious leaders read the Scriptures often, but they failed to benefit from what they read. Jesus highlighted three ways in which these men were not getting the most out of the Scriptures. His words to them will help us improve in our ability (1) to understand what we read, (2) to find spiritual treasures, and (3) to allow God’s Word to mold us. w23.02 8-9 paragraphs 2-3",

        "Scripture": "The shrewd one sees the danger and conceals himself.—Proverbs 22:3.",
        "Explanation": "Some dangers that we must avoid include flirting, heavy drinking, overeating, engaging in hurtful speech, as well as viewing violent entertainment, pornography, and similar things. (Psalm 101:3) The Devil is constantly looking for opportunities to damage our friendship with Jehovah. (1 Peter 5:8) If we are not watchful, Satan can plant in our mind and heart seeds of envy, dishonesty, greed, hatred, haughtiness, and resentment. (Galatians 5:19-21) If we do not take immediate steps to uproot them, they will continue to grow like a poisonous plant and cause trouble. (James 1:14,15) One subtle danger is bad association. We must remember that we will be strongly influenced by those with whom we choose to spend our time. (1 Corinthians 15:33) If we pay attention to ourselves, we will avoid unnecessary association with those who do not live by Jehovah’s standards. (Luke 21:34; 2 Corinthians 6:15) We will see the danger and steer clear of it. w23.02 16 paragraph 7; 17 paragraphs 10-11",

        "Scripture": "This is what the love of God means, that we observe his commandments.—1 John 5:3.",
        "Explanation": "Your love for Jehovah has grown as you have learned more about him. Surely you want to draw closer to him now and forever. And you can. He kindly encourages you to make his heart rejoice. (Proverbs 23:15,16) You can do that not only by words but also by actions. The way you live your life will show that you truly love Jehovah. That is the best goal in life you could ever choose. How can you demonstrate your love for Jehovah? First, you offer a special prayer in which you dedicate yourself to the only true God. (Psalm 40:8) Then, you make that private dedication public by getting baptized. That becomes a happy milestone, a great turning point. You start out on a new life, not for yourself, but for Jehovah.
